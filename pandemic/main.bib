  title     = "Epistemic corruption, the pharmaceutical industry, and the body
               of medical science",
  author    = "Sismondo, Sergio",
  abstract  = "When a knowledge system importantly loses integrity, ceasing to
               provide the kinds of trusted knowledge expected of it, we can
               label this epistemic corruption. Epistemic corruption often
               occurs because the system has been co-opted for interests at
               odds with some of the central goals thought to lie behind it.
               There is now abundant evidence that the involvement of
               pharmaceutical companies corrupts medical science. Within the
               medical community, this is generally assumed to be the result of
               conflicts of interest. However, some important ways that the
               industry corrupts are not captured well by standard analyses in
               terms of conflicts of interest. It is not just that there is a
               body of medical science perverted by industry largesse. Instead,
               much of the corruption of medical science via the pharmaceutical
               industry happens through grafting activities: Pharmaceutical
               companies do their own research and smoothly integrate it with
               medical science, taking advantage of the legitimacy of the
               latter.",

               articles were included. RESULTS: The results showed that

               damage, cytokine-induced inflammation, and lymphopenia in viral
               diseases similar to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: These conclusions

However, the VE is significantly lower than that against Delta infection and declines rapidly over just a few months. The VE is re-established upon revaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine (54.6\%, 95\% CI: 30.4 to 70.4\%).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:We used only administrative register data for the study. According to Danish law, ethics approval is exempt for such research, and the Danish Data Protection Agency, which is a dedicated ethics and legal oversight body, thus waives ethical approval for our study of administrative register data, when no individual contact of participants is necessary and only aggregate results are included as findings. The study is therefore fully compliant with all legal and ethical requirements and there are no further processes available regarding such studies.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).YesI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material as supplementary files, if applicable.YesDe-identified data are available for access to members of the scientific and medical community for non-commercial use only upon reasonable request to the authors},

  title     = "Why remdesivir failed: Preclinical assumptions overestimate the
               clinical efficacy of remdesivir for {COVID-19} and Ebola",
  author    = "Yan, Victoria C and Muller, Florian L",
  abstract  = "Remdesivir is a nucleoside monophosphoramidate prodrug that has
               been FDA approved for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
               However, the clinical efficacy of remdesivir for COVID-19
               remains contentious, as several trials have not found
               statistically significant differences in either time to clinical
               improvement or mortality between remdesivir-treated and control
               groups. Similarly, the inability of remdesivir to provide a
               clinically significant benefit above other investigational
               agents in patients with Ebola contrasts with strong, curative
               preclinical data generated in rhesus macaque models. For both
               COVID-19 and Ebola, significant discordance between the robust
               preclinical data and remdesivir's lackluster clinical
               performance have left many puzzled. Here, we critically evaluate
               the assumptions of the models underlying remdesivir's promising
               preclinical data and show that such assumptions overpredict
               efficacy and minimize toxicity of remdesivir in humans. Had the
               limitations of in vitro drug efficacy testing and species
               differences in drug metabolism been considered, the
               underwhelming clinical performance of remdesivir for both
               COVID-19 and Ebola would have been fully anticipated.",

	abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the difference in mortality of patients treated with ivermectin vs patients treated with remdesivir with COVID-19 in United States using TriNetX Research network, a federated EMR network of over 44 healthcare organizations and 68 million patients from US, from 2009-2021.
Methods & Materials
We retrospectively identified adults (≥18 years) with a recorded COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020 and July 11, 2021. We compared those with recorded use of ivermectin, but not remdesivir, against those with recorded use of remdesivir, but not ivermectin. We controlled for the following demographics, comorbidities, and treatments that may affect COVID-19 survival outcomes: age, gender, race, ethnicity, nicotine use diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic lower respiratory disease, ischemic heart diseases, tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, or ventilator use. We measured association with mortality as the primary outcome, with significance assessed at p<0.05.
Results
There were a total of 1,761,060 possible COVID-19 patients based on ICD-10 diagnostic terms and confirmatory lab results. Prior to controlling, our analysis yielded 41,608 patients who had COVID-19 resulting in two unique cohorts that were treated with either ivermectin (1,072) or remdesivir (40,536). Within the ivermectin cohort, average age was 51.9 + 17.8 years, 43% were male, 60% had glucocorticoids and 1% required ventilator support. In the remdesivir cohort, average age was 62.0 + 16.0 years, 54% were male, 64% had glucocorticoids and 2% required ventilator support. After using propensity score matching and adjusting for potential confounders, ivermectin was associated with reduced mortality vs remdesivir (OR 0.308, 95% CI (0.198,0.479)),Risk Difference -5.224%, CI (-7.079%,-3.369%), p <0.0001.
Conclusion
Ivermectin use was associated with decreased mortality in patients with COVID-19 compared to remdesivir. To our knowledge, this is the largest association study of patients with COVID-19, mortality and ivermectin. Further double-blinded placebo-controlled RCTs with large samples are required for definite conclusion. In the future, if more publications are published with the similar result to the current analyses, the certainty of evidence will increase.},

	abstract = {Background Scientists have so far been unable to determine the reason for the low number of COVID-19 cases in Africa.Objective To evaluate the impact of ivermectin interventions for onchocerciasis on the morbidity, mortality, recovery, and fatality rates caused by COVID-19.Method A retrospective statistical analysis study of the impact of ivermectin against COVID-19 between the 31 onchocerciasis-endemic countries using the community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) and the non-endemic 22 countries in Africa. The morbidity, mortality, recovery rate, and fatality rate caused by COVID-19 were calculated from the WHO situation report in Africa. We investigated the onchocerciasis endemic 31 countries and the non-endemic 22 countries. Statistical comparisons used by the Welch test of them in the two groups were made.Results The morbidity and mortality were statistically significantly less in the 31 countries using CDTI. The recovery and fatality rates were not statistically significant difference. The average life expectancy was statistically significantly higher in the non-endemic countries.Conclusions The morbidity and mortality in the onchocerciasis endemic countries are lesser than those in the non-endemic ones. The community-directed onchocerciasis treatment with ivermectin is the most reasonable explanation for the decrease in morbidity and fatality rate in Africa. In areas where ivermectin is distributed to and used by the entire population, it leads to a significant reduction in mortality.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding was received.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Ethical approval was not required for this work as public data analysis.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Objective Studies have demonstrated a potential correlation between low vitamin D status and both an increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and poorer clinical outcomes. This retrospective study examines if, and to what degree, a relationship exists between pre-infection serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level and disease severity and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2.   Participants The records of individuals admitted between April 7th, 2020 and February 4th, 2021 to the Galilee Medical Center (GMC) in Nahariya, Israel, with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) were searched for historical 25(OH)D levels measured 14 to 730 days prior to the positive PCR test.   Design Patients admitted to GMC with COVID-19 were categorized according to disease severity and level of 25(OH)D. An association between pre-infection 25(OH)D levels, divided between four categories (deficient, insufficient, adequate, and high-normal), and COVID-19 severity was ascertained utilizing a multivariable regression analysis. To isolate the possible influence of the sinusoidal pattern of seasonal 25(OH)D changes throughout the year, a cosinor model was used.   Results Of 1176 patients admitted, 253 had records of a 25(OH)D level prior to COVID-19 infection. A lower vitamin D status was more common in patients with the severe or critical disease (<20 ng/mL [87.4%]) than in individuals with mild or moderate disease (<20 ng/mL [34.3%] p < 0.001). Patients with vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) were 14 times more likely to have severe or critical disease than patients with 25(OH)D ≥40 ng/mL (odds ratio [OR], 14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 51; p < 0.001).   Conclusions Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients, pre-infection deficiency of vitamin D was associated with increased disease severity and mortality.},

Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality rate, length of hospital stay (LOS), and adverse events (AEs). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs (SAEs). The risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed, with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methods.Ten RCTs (n = 1173) were included. The controls were the standard of care in 5 RCTs and placebo in 5. COVID-19 disease severity was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in 1, and mild and moderate in 1. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality rates compared with controls (relative risk [RR], 0.37 [95\\% confidence interval, .12--1.13]; very low QoE) or LOS compared with controls (mean difference, 0.72 days [95\\% confidence interval, −.86 to 2.29 days]; very low QoE). AEs, SAEs, and viral clearance were similar between IVM and control groups (low QoE for all outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality rates in 3 RCTs at high RoB were reduced with IVM.Compared with the standard of care or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, LOS, or viral clearance in RCTs in patients with mostly mild COVID-19. IVM did not have an effect on AEs or SAEs and is not a viable option to treat patients with COVID-19.}},

The risks and outcomes of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are unclear.To describe reports of myocarditis and the reporting rates after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US.Descriptive study of reports of myocarditis to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) that occurred after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine administration between December 2020 and August 2021 in 192 405 448 individuals older than 12 years of age in the US; data were processed by VAERS as of September 30, 2021.Vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna).Reports of myocarditis to VAERS were adjudicated and summarized for all age groups. Crude reporting rates were calculated across age and sex strata. Expected rates of myocarditis by age and sex were calculated using 2017-2019 claims data. For persons younger than 30 years of age, medical record reviews and clinician interviews were conducted to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic test results, treatment, and early outcomes.Among 192 405 448 persons receiving a total of 354 100 845 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines during the study period, there were 1991 reports of myocarditis to VAERS and 1626 of these reports met the case definition of myocarditis. Of those with myocarditis, the median age was 21 years (IQR, 16-31 years) and the median time to symptom onset was 2 days (IQR, 1-3 days). Males comprised 82\\% of the myocarditis cases for whom sex was reported. The crude reporting rates for cases of myocarditis within 7 days after COVID-19 vaccination exceeded the expected rates of myocarditis across multiple age and sex strata. The rates of myocarditis were highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males aged 12 to 15 years (70.7 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), in adolescent males aged 16 to 17 years (105.9 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), and in young men aged 18 to 24 years (52.4 and 56.3 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine, respectively). There were 826 cases of myocarditis among those younger than 30 years of age who had detailed clinical information available; of these cases, 792 of 809 (98\\%) had elevated troponin levels, 569 of 794 (72\\%) had abnormal electrocardiogram results, and 223 of 312 (72\\%) had abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results. Approximately 96\\% of persons (784/813) were hospitalized and 87\\% (577/661) of these had resolution of presenting symptoms by hospital discharge. The most common treatment was nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (589/676; 87\\%).Based on passive surveillance reporting in the US, the risk of myocarditis after receiving mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines was increased across multiple age and sex strata and was highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males and young men. This risk should be considered in the context of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.}},

	abstract = {Background
Previous studies evaluated the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety or compared adverse events following vaccination to those from infection. Limited data about the impact of prior infection on post-vaccine adverse events are available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on outcomes shortly after vaccination using a longitudinal design.
Methods
Nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study of hospitalization, death, and pre-specified adverse event rates among Veterans who received mRNA vaccines within the Veterans Health Administration between 12/11/2020 and 8/31/2021. Daily incidence rates were compared before and after vaccine doses, stratified by history of microbiologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
Results
3,118,802 patients received a first dose and 2,979,326 a second, including 102,829 with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Daily incident hospitalization rates were unchanged before and after the second dose among patients without previous infection (28.8/100,000 post-dose versus 28.6/100,000 pre-dose, p = 0.92). In previously-infected patients, the hospitalization rate increased above baseline one day following vaccination (158.2/100,000 after dose 2 versus 57.3/100,000 pre-dose, p < 0.001), then returned to baseline. Chart review indicated vaccine side effects, such as fever, constitutional symptoms, weakness, or falls, as the definite (39%) or possible (18%) cause of hospitalization. Affected patients had mean age 75, and 90% had at least one serious comorbidity. Hospitalizations were brief (median 2 days), with rapid return to baseline health. Worse baseline health among previously-infected patients prevented conclusions about mortality risk.
Conclusions
Two-dose mRNA vaccine regimens are safe in a population with many comorbidities. Transient increased risks of hospitalization were identified among patients with prior SARS-CoV-2, absolute risk ∼1:1000. Findings support additional study regarding the optimal dosing schedule in this population.

	abstract = {Background Reports of waning vaccine-induced immunity against COVID-19 have begun to surface. With that, the comparable long-term protection conferred by previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear.Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-na{\"\i}ve individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.Results SARS-CoV-2-na{\"\i}ve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95\% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P\&lt;0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 na{\"\i}ve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95\% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95\% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-na{\"\i}ve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected.Conclusions This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere was no external funding for the project.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the MHS (Maccabi Healthcare Services) Institutional Review Board (IRB).

	abstract = {Immune memory against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) helps to determine protection against reinfection, disease risk, and vaccine efficacy. Using 188 human cases across the range of severity of COVID-19, Dan et al. analyzed cross-sectional data describing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells for more than 6 months after infection. The authors found a high degree of heterogeneity in the magnitude of adaptive immune responses that persisted into the immune memory phase to the virus. However, immune memory in three immunological compartments remained measurable in greater than 90\% of subjects for more than 5 months after infection. Despite the heterogeneity of immune responses, these results show that durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility for most individuals. Science, this issue p. eabf4063 Immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable, but protection against reinfection and subsequent disease seems possible in most cases. Understanding immune memory to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines and for assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples at ≥6 months after infection. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the spike protein was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2--specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3 to 5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics.},

	abstract = {Remdesivir, a repurposed antiviral, was first accorded approval
              by the US Food Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
              COVID-19 which necessitates hospitalization. However, the interim
              data of SOLIDARITY trial revealed no benefits with remdesivir for
              COVID-19 patients which led immediate debates in social media and
              the press about the utility of the drug. Both preclinical and
              clinical data demonstrated its efficacy in COVID-19. The recently
              concluded ACTT-1 trial showed its efficacy in reducing the
              duration of hospital stay which is of utmost importance for a
              country like India where reduction in bed occupancy can save
              lives of many and eases the financial burden of patient and
              government. Our benefit-risk analysis of ACTT-1 trial also
              favored the use of remdesivir over standard of care. The
              SOLIDARITY trial was fundamentally different from other clinical
              trials on remdesivir with respect to its design, adaptive nature,
              and selection of endpoints. Moreover, the success of antiviral
              therapy also depends on the timing of initiation and combination
              with other drugs. Hence we believe that drugs like Remdesivir are
              very important for countries like India where soft end points
              such as time to recovery and clinical improvement and early
              discharge become extremely significant during a pandemic.},

	abstract = {African Americans have higher incidence of, and mortality from,
               many health-related problems than European Americans. They also
               have a 15 to 20-fold higher prevalence of severe vitamin D
               deficiency. Here we summarize evidence that: (i) this health
               disparity is partly due to insufficient vitamin D production,
               caused by melanin in the skin blocking the UVB solar radiation
               necessary for its synthesis; (ii) the vitamin D insufficiency is
               exacerbated at high latitudes because of the combination of dark
               skin color with lower UVB radiation levels; and (iii) the health
               of individuals with dark skin can be markedly improved by
               correcting deficiency and achieving an optimal vitamin D status,
               as could be obtained by supplementation and/or fortification.
               Moderate-to-strong evidence exists that high 25-hydroxyvitamin D
               levels and/or vitamin D supplementation reduces risk for many
               adverse health outcomes including all-cause mortality rate,
               adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, cancer, diabetes mellitus,
               Alzheimer's disease and dementia, multiple sclerosis, acute
               respiratory tract infections, COVID-19, asthma exacerbations,
               rickets, and osteomalacia. We suggest that people with low
               vitamin D status, which would include most people with dark skin
               living at high latitudes, along with their health care provider,
               consider taking vitamin D3 supplements to raise serum
               25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) or possibly
               higher.},

@article{Behera2021-qu,
	abstract = {Introduction Healthcare workers (HCWs) are vulnerable to getting
               infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
               (SARS-CoV-2). Preventing HCWs from getting infected is a
               priority to maintain healthcare services. The therapeutic and
               preventive role of ivermectin in coronavirus disease 2019
               (COVID-19) is being investigated. Based on promising results of
               in vitro studies of oral ivermectin, this study was conducted
               with the aim to demonstrate the prophylactic role of oral
               ivermectin in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs at the
               All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Bhubaneswar.
               Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted at AIIMS
               Bhubaneswar, which has been providing both COVID and non-COVID
               care since March 2020. All employees and students of the
               institute who provided written informed consent participated in
               the study. The uptake of two doses of oral ivermectin (300
               $\mu$g/kg/dose at a gap of 72 hours) was considered as exposure.
               The primary outcome of the study was COVID-19 infection in the
               following month of ivermectin consumption, diagnosed as per
               Government of India testing criteria (real-time reverse
               transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) guidelines.
               The log-binomial model was used to estimate adjusted relative
               risk (ARR), and the Kaplan-Meier failure plot was used to
               estimate the probability of COVID-19 infection with follow-up
               time. Results Of 3892 employees, 3532 (90.8\%) participated in
               the study. The ivermectin uptake was 62.5\% and 5.3\% for two
               doses and single dose, respectively. Participants who took
               ivermectin prophylaxis had a lower risk of getting symptoms
               suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection (6\% vs 15\%). HCWs who had
               taken two doses of oral ivermectin had a significantly lower
               risk of contracting COVID-19 infection during the following
               month (ARR 0.17; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.23). Females had a lower risk
               of contracting COVID-19 than males (ARR 0.70; 95\% CI,
               0.52-0.93). The absolute risk reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection
               was 9.7\%. Only 1.8\% of the participants reported adverse
               events, which were mild and self-limiting. Conclusion Two doses
               of oral ivermectin (300 $\mu$g/kg/dose given 72 hours apart) as
               chemoprophylaxis among HCWs reduced the risk of COVID-19
               infection by 83\% in the following month. Safe, effective, and
               low-cost chemoprophylaxis has relevance in the containment of
               pandemic alongside vaccine.},
