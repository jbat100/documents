\section*{Background}

I used to believe that all this was inevitable, that we did our best. There were costly mistakes made along the way, but things were complicated. We locked down, we rolled out vaccines as soon as possible, and started pressuring people to take them. It was for the good of all. It was the only way. I’ve changed, I think we could have done so much better, and when this all happens again we need to do better. 

It started in the summer of 2021, I heard an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience with Bret Weinstein and Pierre Kory who were talking about repurposed drugs for prophylaxis and therapeutics, which supposedly had the power to end the pandemic whenever we chose to deploy it at scale. I was sceptical, surely we would have done it if we could. I put it in a corner of my mind. I’d been listening to Bret Weinstein speaking on a broad range of topics for a while, and he always impressed me with his refreshing combination of open mindedness and careful, serious scientific rigour. In a world which seemed to loose it’s grip his felt like a voice of reason, striking nuance between the extremes. After reading a number of articles which seemed to categorically discard Ivermectin as a potential help, I decided to forget about it. Even Merck who manufacture the drug said it didn’t work and warned against using it. Bret Weinstein could be wrong, like everyone, and on this one he probably was.

A few month later I heard that Oxford University had added Ivermectin to their PRINCIPLE trial. I started wondering why, this drug which I’d read was not only useless in treating COVID-19, but was also dangerous and used as a horse dewormer would be investigated by extremely competent people. So I went back to the episode I heard, and listened to a few more episodes including Robert Malone and Peter McCollough. These people were described by the mainstream media as spreading misinformation and yet seemed extremely intelligent, well meaning and could not have been more qualified. So I decided to start systematically fact checking them, as well as the dominant narratives. It was quite a ride, and overall they have proved to be the most valuable source of information I’ve had throughout this pandemic.

\section*{The only solutions were the ones we were allowed}

It was early 2020, the waves were coming, people panicked. Hospitals were getting overloaded with people who were struggling to breathe, they needed ventilators, they were dying. There was a rush to find effective treatments and therapeutics, mountains of data from around the world was pouring in with many promising leads. The decisions however were not to be made or influenced by doctors and physicians in hospitals and clinics who knew this new disease better than anyone. Instead they were made by a handpicked few, with strong ties to the pharmaceutical industry. The bar for recommendation was set. It was to be large centralised randomised double blind trials, not accumulated experience by people on the front line.

These large trials are expensive, tens of millions of dollars. The only entities capable of running them  fast enough were corporate pharmaceutical giants with obvious conflicts of interest. Profits often at odds with patient wellbeing. Remdesivir won the race after mediocre results which were made barely statistically significant by a large sample size, in a study largely funded by tax payer money for private benefits. Safety protocols were short circuited and an emergency authorisation was given by the FDA. It was then enforced as the recommended treatment with a price tag of thousands of dollars per patient. Doctors and physicians across the US and much of the western world had their hands tied by central medical authorities and piloting committees. 

We briefly heard about vitamin D, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and many other potential avenues of investigation, but these were quickly and neatly tidied up by our legacy and social media. They were systematically discarded, debunked and their proponents were paraded as clowns, lunatics, conspiracy theorists. No large government funded trials or shortcuts and exceptions for them, only scientific scepticism, journalistic derision and public indifference. Any solution would need to be new and above all, corporate. Our arsenal of public domain tools were declared useless by the deciders. There were no monthly reviews of medical evidence from people on the front line, just death counts and prayers.

Of course another solution was needed, because Remdesivir, despite its huge price tag and serious side effects, didn’t significantly reduce mortality. So the attention turned to vaccines. We waited for our saviours to develop them in our domestic prison cells. The familiar pattern of public tax payer money funding products for private profits, had an additional twist. The liability for adverse effects would not be theirs to bare and governments around the world would enforce their use. A corporate paradise. Safety procedures were short circuited again, citizens were given the choice between self imprisonment, triweekly punitive nose rape or experimental vaccines. Workers, including exhausted front line medics were faced with obligatory vaccination or starvation. People started policing each other. We needed the boosters, and super boosters, adolescents, children. One. single. solution.

Mounting evidence against systematic repeated total vaccination and any information which could lead to vaccine scepticism was systematically classified as misinformation by mainstream and social media platforms. Whether they were true or not was irrelevant. Truth was redefined, vaccines were the only truth. Self organised groups with hundreds of thousands of adverse effect sufferers were disappeared. Crushing evidence from around the world censored and firewalled to ensure compliance. 

\section*{Tales from around the world}

While we were busy worrying about when the vaccines would finally save us, elsewhere around the world people knew they could only count on themselves. Although they could, of course, also count on the WHO and the FDA to spread their corporate driven Remdesivir recommendations and vaccine fanaticism with great effect, some decided to take matters in their own hands. None of this has pierced through the western media firewall, but the information is easily discoverable if you know what to look for.

Uttar Pradesh (the most populous state in India) replicated results from numerous small scale studies showing insanely good results for prophylactic Ivermectin and Vitamin D and decided to base their approach on these results using targeted med-kits for positive tests and contact cases. Their government declared that this helped them keep mortality down to a surprising extent. They were praised by the WHO who referred to their med-kits without referring to what was inside, presumably because it went against their own recommendations. Although Uttar Pradesh is less vaccinated and more densely populated than the second most populous state in India (Maharashtra), their mortality rate is 11 times lower overall and has been throughout the pandemic. This was not considered worth any attention by our scientific, pharmaceutical, media and governmental institutions. An irrational reaction by any measure.

The third state in India (by population), Bahir followed Uttar Pradesh’s lead and obtained similar breathtaking results. Elsewhere in India, the two states of Uttarakhand and Kerala gave us a natural experiment of unusual magnitude. Uttarakhand decided to deploy prophylactic Ivermectin as a response to the Delta wave in may 2021, their daily mortality went down to zero within two month and has essentially stayed there ever since. Kerala conversely was using Ivermectin up to summer 2021, when they succumbed to pressure from the WHO in the middle of the Delta wave. They dropped their protocol it in favour of the expensive and ineffective Remdesivir. Their mortality rate has exploded and remained extremely high ever since. No one at the WHO thought this was an indication that their recommendation might have been a factor.   

Peru offered another large scale real world experiment in ivermectin deployment. The mortality for over 60 year olds was cut 14 fold in three month after the introduction of ivermectin, then jumped back up 13 fold once the new president restricted its use. Per state analysis for 25 states showed the effects to be tied to deployment date and quantity with a very high significance. Africa, where a number of countries have been using ivermectin systematically for over 35 years to treat an array of different tropical diseases to great effect provided an accidental demonstration of ivermectin’s effectiveness. Based on a comparative study of African state which used and didn’t use ivermectin, the chairman of the Tokyo Metropolitan Medical Association decided to allow doctors to use ivermectin off label (while not officially recommending it as it would be in direct defiance of the WHO recommendations) to deal with an uncontrollable situation. As expected the mortality rates dropped to zero within three months.

All around the world, using cheap repurposed drugs, states, provinces and countries defied the WHO and obtained results which western countries could only dream of. This would be if they knew about it, because a concerted effort was made to conceal these successes and prevent the idea that therapeutics could help control the pandemic from ever surfacing in the public discussion. Ultra qualified doctors were screaming for these things to be tried and were demonised, falsely classified as antivax and censored from nearly all platforms. 

\section*{Misinformation works best when it comes from above}

The narrative surrounding the pandemic has been relentlessly hammered into our minds throughout the passed two years. Using carefully selected informational emphasis and systematic censorship, demonisation and ridicule of dissent our institutions have imposed lockdowns and vaccination to the people. This has been remarkably effective, but cracks have started to appear. The narrative has shown itself to be paper thin to anyone who cares to look for themselves. A few case studies of systemic misinformation.

\subsection*{Ivermectin}

The mainstream media depiction of ivermectin is that of a horse dewormer, dangerous to humans,  shown to be ineffective by many scientific studies. Conspiracy theorists have miraculously convinced many of it’s efficacy against the recommendations of scientists, the WHO and the FDA. It's possible use as a prophylactic and early therapeutic was more implausible than flat earth theories based on the tone of hijacked wikipedia pages. 

Textbook misinformation. Ivermectin has been widely used in humans since 1987 with an exceptional safety record. It won its inventor the Nobel Prize and is on the WHO’s list of essential medicines. It has essentially eradicated a number of tropical diseases in Africa, and was so effective, cheap and safe that Merck created a large scale donation program with over 4 billion doses distributed over 35 years (presumably they didn't think it was dangerous until COVID-19 hit and then changed their minds despite studies \href{https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/8/Supplement_1/S365/6450290}{confirming the absence of adverse effects for treating it}). 

It was identified as an extremely promising prophylactic and therapeutic for COVID-19 early on and many preliminary studies suggested very high effectiveness. These never translated into the large scale RCT necessary for wide scale adoption however as nobody had the financial incentive to perform them, while big Pharma had every incentive to discourage further investigation. Meta-analyses were routinely cited as demonstrating the insignificance of its effect, when in fact they noted the poor quality of the data (insufficient sample size and inaccuracies) and emphasised the urgency of large RCT given the promising nature of the results. Papers reporting large scale effects in test runs have been pulled based on \href{https://healthpolicy-watch.news/mexico-city-officials-in-row-over-misleading-paper-to-justify-its-ivermectin-drive/}{ethical concerns and lack of informed consent}, which clearly is very big issue for highly safe repurposed drugs but not experimental vaccines. We should be so grateful for their concern.

But the papers and reports keep coming in, and justifying the will of so many doctors and scientist to push for a drug which they have no financial (or other) interest in promoting and everything to lose from the backlash is becoming increasingly difficult. A number of prestigious institutions are in the process of performing the large RCT trials, but without the exceptional treatment which was afforded to Remdesivir and the usual hurdles of publicly funded research (funding, ethics, peer reviews etc...), the timescale is in years and of no help in the context of a pandemic. Given the outstanding safety record of ivermectin, the risk benefit ratio of large scale test deployments is essentially unarguable and would have settled the issue, like so many countries less prone to corporate influence have done.
